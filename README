Required runtime dependencies
=============================

    bash      : required for the main script [file: ponysay]

    cowsay    : this is a wrapper for cowsay

    coreutils : the main script [file: ponysay] uses stty, cut, ls, cat, head and tail

    sed       : used to remove .pony from pony named when running ponysay -l


Optional runtime dependencies
=============================

    (none)


Package building dependencies
=============================

    gcc       : used for compiling ponysaytruncater.c

    gzip      : used for compressing manpages

    make      : required to run the make script

    coreutils : make script uses install unlink rm ln mkdir cp


Dependencies for pony providers
===============================

    make      : required to run `make ttyponies` 

    coreutils : ln and readlink are used in ttyponies.sh

    bash      : required to run ttyponies.sh

    util-say  : used by ttyponies.sh to builder ttyponies from xterm ponies
    -- Available for Arch:ers in AUR as util-say-git (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=60241)
    -- and on github at https://github.com/maandree/util-say


Installation on GNU/Linux (or other Unix implementations)
=========================================================

    Before installing ponysay, make sure your system have the packages listed under
    [Required runtime dependencies] and [Package building dependencies] installed.
    
    Download or clone the project.  bleeding edge:  https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tarball/master
    	     	      	  	    release:        https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/tags
    
    In the terminal, `cd` into the ponysay directory and execute `make && make install`.
    This will install ponysay into the $PREFIX (/usr by default, meaning you may need to
    run `make install` as root, e.g by running `sudo make install`.)
    
    In order to use ponysay, run:                 ponysay "I am just the cutest pony!"
    Or if you have a specific pony in your mind:  ponysay -f pinkie "Partay!~"
    
    Run `info ponysay`, `man 6 ponysay` (man ponysay) or `ponysay -h` for more information.
    A Spanish manual is available: man -L es 6 ponysay


Pony fortune on terminal startup
================================

    This requires that you have fortune utility installed. You can install it from your
    distributions package repository, it should be named fortune or fortune-mod.
    
    Edit your ~/.bashrc and this line [to the end should work]:
    
        fortune | ponysay
    
    Now every time you open a terminal a pony should give your fortune.
    
    If you wany ponified fortuned the are some stuff you can try:
        
        A gigantic sed script:
