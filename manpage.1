.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBponysay\fP displays an image of a pony saying some text provided by the user in a terminal.
It is a wrapper for \fIcowsay\fP. If \fImessage\fP is not provided, it accepts standard input,
word-wraps the message given at about 40 columns, and prints the pony saying the given message on standard output.
.PP
If no arguments are provided, the program only accepts standard input piped from another program, a file or
either here documents or here strings (see man bash(1) for details on here document/string.)
